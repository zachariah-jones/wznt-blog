## 💡 Why I Created This Website  
I built this website to act as a **living portfolio and knowledge hub**.  

Like many in tech, I’ve spent years experimenting, **breaking things, and fixing them again**. Whether it’s setting up home lab environments, automating workflows, or studying cybersecurity, I realized that documenting my progress publicly would serve two purposes:  

✅ **Helping others** – If someone else can learn from my posts, that's a win.  
✅ **Holding myself accountable** – Writing about my work forces me to understand topics deeply.  

This website is **fully automated**, meaning all blog posts are created through a **custom script** that formats, commits, and deploys new content instantly via **GitHub and Cloudflare Pages**. No manual intervention needed—just knowledge sharing at its finest.

- 📌 **Studying for the CompTIA Security+ certification** to strengthen my cybersecurity fundamentals.  
- 🖥 **Building and managing my own home lab** to get hands-on experience with networking, virtual machines, and security tools.  
- ⚡ **Exploring automation** through scripting, self-hosted tools, and cloud integrations.  
- 🕵️ **Experimenting with cybersecurity techniques** using platforms like TryHackMe.  

My goal is to **land a fully remote cybersecurity role** while continuing to learn, document, and share what I discover along the way.
